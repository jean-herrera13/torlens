```

Make sure you have Node.js installed. If you don’t have it yet, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## Usage

Here’s a quick example of how to use TorLens in your project:

```javascript
const TorLens = require('torlens');

// Create a new instance
const tor = new TorLens();

// Query for relay information
tor.getRelayInfo('some_relay_address')
  .then(info => {
    console.log(info);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching relay info:', error);
  });
```

This example demonstrates how to create a new instance of TorLens and fetch information about a specific relay. You can explore more features and functionalities in the API reference section.
